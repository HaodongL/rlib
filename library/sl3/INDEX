train_task              Subset Tasks for CV THe functions use origami
                        folds to subset tasks. These functions are used
                        by Lrnr_cv (and therefore other learners that
                        use Lrnr_cv). So that nested cv works properly,
                        currently the subsetted task objects do not
                        have fold structures of their own, and so
                        generate them from defaults if nested cv is
                        requested.
